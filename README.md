Install [gloria](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gloria) using npm:

```
npm install -g gloria
```

This will install a command to build and run the site locally.

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:techqueria/swlatinx.git
cd swlatinx
gloria serve -b
```

The homepage is in `index.html`, make the changes required
there and commit and push.

The site uses bootstrap as CSS library, look
at their [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) for examples, and
information on how to use it.
